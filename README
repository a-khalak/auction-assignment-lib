This directory contains a generic implementation of the 
Bertsekas auction algorithm for asymmetric assignment.

see Bertsekas, D.P.  Linear Network Optimization: Algorithms and Codes,
    Cambridge, MA.  MIT Press.  1991.

This particular version contains extra features, beyond those described
in the reference above, which allow the algorithm to avoid problems with
identical rows and indentical columns.  These add-ons to the algorithm
are described, among other places, in

    Castanon, D.A., Athans, M., Hatch, K., Sandell, N., Stonestreet, W.,
    Trivizas, D., and Tsaknakis, H,   Advanced Weapon Target Assignment
    Algorithms Program Algorithm Approaches Report., Alphatech Report TR-428,
    May 1989. and in Appendix A, in particular.

auction.cc          - Auction Algorithm.
auction.h           - Contains helper classes for constructing inputs, 
			should be included in wrapper code
auction_driver.cc   - This wrapper reads data from a file and stores the
                        non-zero entries in compressed-row Sparse Matrix
			format.  The input objects to the auction algorithm
			are constructed with compressed-row inputs. 
auction_driver2.cc  - This wrapper reads data from a file and stores it
                        in a dense matrix (i.e. vector of vectors).  This
			version uses a constructor for the input objects
			that automatically converts from dense format to
			compressed-row (i.e. sparse) format for use in the 
                        auction algorithm.

Porting notes for NT(VC++ 6.0):

1. In order to compile on NT, the file mtl_set.h needs to comment out the 
   template mtl::set(...){...} or put it between the preprocessor directives:
   #ifndef NT_PORT
   #endif

2. mtl lib for different platform are kept in different directories:
   Unix-   src/auction/unix/mtl      - path set in auction.mak & Makefile
   NT  -   src/auction/nt/mtl        - path set in auction.dsp & auction.dsw
