This directory contains a generic implementation of the Bertsekas auction algorithm for asymmetric assignment.

see Bertsekas, D.P.  Linear Network Optimization: Algorithms and Codes,
    Cambridge, MA.  MIT Press.  1991.

This particular version contains extra features which resolves problems with the stock algorithm when dealing with identical rows and indentical columns.  The c++ code was written in the 2000-2001 timeframe, and is being slowly modernized.
